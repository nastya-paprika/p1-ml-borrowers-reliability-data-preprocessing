They likely include those with very low income (who avoid taking large loans and pay on time to avoid penalties) and those with very high income (who have the financial cushion to handle payments without stress).\n",

They likely have multiple credit obligations that are difficult to service with their current income levels, leading to a higher frequency of missed payments."

    "- For Group 2: These borrowers face specific financial strains. Students may find it difficult to balance work and study, impacting their income stability. Car owners often face additional unexpected costs (maintenance, repairs, insurance) that reduce their ability to make loan payments on time."
